                This page was created for the scope of an assignment in a DB cource of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The purpose
                of this application is to store data used in Version Control Systems (VCS) such as GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket. All this
                saved data and information will allow easy and fast export of statistical measurements. Analyzing the data will become easier
                for people in the programming field.
